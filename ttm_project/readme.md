It seems there's an issue with pip installation permissions. Let's try a different approach using Python's built-in venv module instead of virtualenv. Here's what to do:

1. First create a new directory for your project:
```bash
mkdir ttm_project
cd ttm_project
```

2. Create a virtual environment using Python's built-in venv:
```bash
python -m venv myenv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment (in Windows Git Bash):
```bash
source myenv/Scripts/activate
```

4. Once activated (you should see `(myenv)` at the start of your prompt), update pip:
```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

Let me know once you've completed these steps and what you see, then we'll proceed with installing the required packages in the virtual environment.


```bash
pip install pandas numpy
```

```bash
pip install scikit-learn
```


```bash
pip install tensorflow
```


```bash
python formula_discovery.py

```



I'll create a script that applies this formula to any new OHLC data to generate signals.



To use this script:

1. Save it as `test_formula.py`

2. Run it with your new JSON file:
```bash
python test_formula.py all.json
```

The script will:
1. Read your new price data
2. Apply the formula we discovered
3. Generate two files:
   - `new_data_signals.js`: Contains just the signals in the same format as your original file
   - `new_data_analysis.csv`: A detailed CSV showing all calculations for verification

This allows you to:
- Test the formula on new data
- Compare the results with actual signals
- See exactly why each signal was generated

Would you like me to add any additional features or modify how the signals are generated?


```bash
pip install ta

```

1. Activate the Virtual Environment
Run this command to activate the venv:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

If successful, your prompt will change, showing the name of the virtual environment (e.g., venv):

```bash
(venv) your-username@your-machine:~/your-project$
```
