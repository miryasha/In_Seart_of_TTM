In deep learning, an **epoch** is a single pass through the entire training dataset by the learning algorithm. It is a fundamental concept in training neural networks.

### **Key Points About Epochs:**

1. **Full Dataset Pass:**
   - During one epoch, the model sees every sample in the training dataset exactly once.
   - If the dataset has 10,000 samples and the batch size is 100, the model will go through 100 batches (10,000 รท 100 = 100) to complete one epoch.

2. **Training Progression:**
   - Training a deep learning model typically requires multiple epochs.
   - With each epoch, the model's weights are updated based on the loss calculated after processing the batches.

3. **Learning Dynamics:**
   - **Underfitting:** If the model is trained with too few epochs, it may not learn enough patterns from the data.
   - **Overfitting:** Training for too many epochs may lead to overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data.

4. **Epoch vs. Batch vs. Iteration:**
   - **Batch:** A subset of the training data passed through the model at once.
   - **Iteration:** One forward and backward pass through the neural network for a single batch.
   - **Epoch:** A complete pass over the entire training dataset.

   For example:
   - Dataset size: 10,000 samples
   - Batch size: 100 samples
   - Iterations per epoch: 10,000 รท 100 = 100
   - Epochs: Number of times the dataset is passed through the model.

5. **Monitoring Epochs:**
   - Training metrics like accuracy and loss are often monitored at the end of each epoch to evaluate the model's performance and adjust hyperparameters if needed.

### Example:
If you are training a model with the following parameters:
- Dataset size: 50,000 samples
- Batch size: 500 samples
- Epochs: 10

Each epoch will process the dataset once, in 50,000 รท 500 = 100 iterations. After 10 epochs, the model will have seen the entire dataset 10 times.

### Choosing the Number of Epochs:
- Use techniques like **early stopping** to prevent overfitting. This halts training when the validation loss stops improving.
- Perform experiments to determine the optimal number of epochs based on your dataset and model.
