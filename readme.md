What is The Scalper?
The Scalper indicator identifies probable highs and lows for a charted symbol. The link below shows how the scalper alert works. 

The indicator determines pivot highs and lows by using a “trigger bar”. The trigger bar is the first bar that has a higher low (or lower high) than the previous bar.

The next bar that closes above the high of the trigger bar (or low for down signals) paints the previous bar which now becomes the swing low (or high) bar and the beginning of a new swing.
